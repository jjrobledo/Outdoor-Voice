## Unsolved Problems

- Posts are protected on the frontend but not the backend - logged in users can't delete or edit posts that don't belong to them on the frontend, but they can still make PATCH and DELETE requests to the backend API.
- Multiple posts can be opened at the same time
- Logout button needs to have cursor set to pointer on stylesheet
- Login and register modals can be opened at the same time
- Properly style the navigation bar
- Work on mobile view

## Future Enhancements

- Users can upload a picture with their posts
- Posts should cluster on the map when zoomed out
- Sidebar showing a scrollable list of all the posts in the map view
